# Nao V50 handless model

Due to the [weird behavior](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_virtual/issues/9) observed in the hand/fingers joints in full-body models, elbow (*L/RElbowYaw*, *L/RElbowRoll*), wrist (*L/RWristYaw*), and hand/finger (*L/RHand*) joints are removed.
Useful when working solely with lower body joints.
